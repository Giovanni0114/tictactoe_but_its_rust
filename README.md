# tictactoe_but_its-rust
This is really simple project, but Rust is my new discovery, and I would like to have some quick refrence repo with it 

# About this all
If you're recruiter who comes here to check if I have neccessary skills for a job, you really should'n search here. It's really random tries, my first steps in new language

# What is this
A tic-tac-toe game. Have you ever played it? I guess. 

Maybe I will add an AI comupter player later, we will see.
